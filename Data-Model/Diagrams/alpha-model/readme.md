#A note for those leaving feedback on the data model

This current draft of the data model has been constructed under the requirements of being interoperable with as many of the products and services that have been indentified in the supplier lots or elsewhere.

For example, the data model is aligned to the metadata requirements of services such as Crossref and Datacite. There is adherance to best practice and guidelines such as the Scholix framework and metadta profiles such as Rioxx and Irus (4Data) UK. Other complex data models, such as Cerif, have been studied and assimilated.

The result is a dense and complex data model, involving many entities, relations and vocabularies. The role of the feedback is to fine tune this data model and ensure that it is interoperable in the desired areas. This means that properties can be removed if not used within the system being described. A reduced data model (and vocabularies) can then be identified as core with additional structure added as required. 

Leave an [issue](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/issues) or [comment](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/issues) and this will be dealt with as the model matures.
