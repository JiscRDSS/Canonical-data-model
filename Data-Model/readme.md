In this folder, you can find details on the data model that has been designed to underpin the Research Data Shared Service alpha development.  

The folder [Concept Model](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/Data-Model/Diagrams/Concept-model) contains a larger but less detailed model of the research process. This model is at a conceptual entity level. The supporting documentation outlines the sources consulted in the development of the model and the rationale behind the decision making.
