#RDSS Data Model

The data model file in this folder can be viewed using [StarUML](http://staruml.io/).

##Background

As part of the the Research Data Shared Service, I was asked to devise a data model which could be understood to underpin the processes for which the Shared Service project seeks to provide an infrastructure. Metadata requirements from across this landscape were considered - current Research Information Systems, repositories etc. The idea was to simplify these processes into activities
