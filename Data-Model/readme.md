In the [diagrams](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/Data-Model/Diagrams) folder, you can find details on the [data model](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/Data-Model/Diagrams/alpha-model) that has been designed to underpin the Research Data Shared Service alpha development.  

The [Concept Model](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/Data-Model/Diagrams/Concept-model) folder contains a larger but less detailed model of the research process. This model is at a conceptual entity level. The supporting documentation outlines the sources consulted in the development of the model and the rationale behind the decision making.

##Distinction between the Logical model & Concept model

The concept model work was undertaken to work out a combination of entities that are common to research data management models and to connect them in a way that made sense within a researcher workflow. The concept model is high level and designed to show the basic building blocks of what a research data management service might look like. This was a guide in order to promote debate and direction about the direction of the data model for the service. It was not complete or exhaustive but a reflection of the frameworks studied to inform thinking.

The alpha logical model is the data model that underpins the Research Data Shared Service alpha version. This is a more worked through, coirrectly annoted model of the entities and relationships that describe the service and its functions. This data model gives a more complete picture of the metadata involved by going into more explicit detail about properties, their relationships and cardinalities. The development of the alpha model is informed by the MVP (what is expected to be delivered by the alpha service), use cases, and feedback from pilot institutions and vendors.

The model provides a template from which software can be created. This blueprint informs the decision making behind the code and informs the messages that pass from software to adaptors and vice versa.
