# Data model

This folder contains the latest version of the RDSS data model. The file can be opened using StarUML (http://staruml.io/) and contains all the metadata element properties. An image of the latest version is also included for quick and easy viewing.

The background folder contains information about the development of the original concept model for RDSS and the schemas and standards that were adhered to in its development.

The data model develops over time and is versioned using semantic versioning.
