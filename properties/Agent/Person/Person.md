##Description

Person is the collection of properties which define a human entity involved with the research project. These properties contain identifiers and require the definition of relationships between the person and other entities.

##Derivation
Person is a conflation of the creator and contributor fields from the [Datacite](http://schema.datacite.org/) schema. This, hopefully, removes the primacy of creation or authorship and allows any relationship (permitted in vocabulary) to be expressed between the Person and any other entity in the data model. The inclusion of identifiers is good practice taken from ORCID, Datacite and user requirements.

##Obligation
Mandatory

Repeatable
