# Data model documentation store

The data model folder contains the latest version for the [alpha service](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/Data-Model/Diagrams/alpha-model). This folder also contains a folder for the concept model. The concept model is for **background information only**.

The [properties](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/properties) folder contains information about the metadata properties present in the data model - including cardinality, derivation and description. This documentation is **work in progress** and is being updated regularly as the data model develops.
