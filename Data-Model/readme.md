In the [diagrams](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/Data-Model/Diagrams) folder, you can find details on the [data model](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/Data-Model/Diagrams/alpha-model) that has been designed to underpin the Research Data Shared Service alpha development.  

The [Concept Model](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/tree/master/Data-Model/Diagrams/Concept-model) folder contains a larger but less detailed model of the research process. This model is at a conceptual entity level. The supporting documentation outlines the sources consulted in the development of the model and the rationale behind the decision making.
