# Data model documentation store

The data model folder contains the latest version for the alpha service. This folder also contains a folder for the concept model. This folder is for **background information only**.

The properties folder contains information about the metadata properties present in the data model - including cardinality, derivation and description. This documentation is **work in progress** and is being updated regularly as the data model develops.
