# Data model

This folder contains the latest version of the Jisc Open Research Hub [Canonical data model](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/blob/master/Data-Model/Canonical-data-model.mdj), which can be opened using StarUML (http://staruml.io/) and contains all of the core metadata element properties. An image of the latest version is also included for quick and easy viewing.

The [Content-Models](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/blob/master/Data-Model/Content-Models) folder contains UML describing content models which inherit from the Canonical data model containing additional metadata specific to certain resource types. 

The [Information-Package](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/blob/master/Data-Model/Information-Package) folder contains UML describing the Information Package model which is used to describe the status of the preservation of Research Objects within the Jisc Open Research Hub. 

The [Background](https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-canonical-data-model/blob/master/Data-Model/Background) folder contains information about the development of the original concept model for the Jisc Open Research Hub and the schemas and standards that were adhered to in its development.

The data model develops over time and is versioned using semantic versioning.
