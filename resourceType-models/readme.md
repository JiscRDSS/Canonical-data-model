# resourceType models

This folder contains additional UML models for objects based on their resource type. The purpose of the models is to detail metadata fields that belong to the resource type in addition to those defined in the canonical data model.

These fields can be related to current best practice in depositing objects in a repository, or may be mandated by external stakeholders, such as funders and academic institutions.

The files are in mdj format and can be opened with [StarUML](http://staruml.io/download).
